# BOMBSQUAD-SERVER

- **The Modded Server for The Game Called BOMBSQUAD with UnderTheHood Features**
- **I focused on speed and must have features rather than grafical mods (which you can easily get tons of mods on the internet)**
- **Mods are compiled against 'C' for having a speedy experience (My intension is not to hide the codes, i can even share it with anyone asked for) but their functions are easily callable to any python file (speed of 'C' with the simplicity of 'Python')**

## Pre-procedure

- Python3.8
- Pip3

## Some Features

- All Config Files and Stats can Auto Backup to the Repo
- Pro Key to Activate Extra Awesome Features
- New Chat and Perks System To Get Started
- All Kinds of Filters including Profanity, Spam
- Introduced League System Based on overall Stats, Obviously cusomisable
- Exterior Written Mods so that We can Update Base Server Files Easily
- Administration System with Custom Time Periods
- Use `/help` in chat to get usage and use of builtin commands
- Custom perks and commands registration with ease (i will write a whole page about this in wiki pages)
- And Obviously a Prefix System
